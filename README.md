The project analyzes the relationship between surface temperature, greenhouse gas emissions, GDP, energy consumption/production, and population using large-scale datasets.
We applied methods including unit root testing, ARDL modeling, cointegration analysis, and panel regression to study both global and country-level effects (with case studies on China and the USA).
